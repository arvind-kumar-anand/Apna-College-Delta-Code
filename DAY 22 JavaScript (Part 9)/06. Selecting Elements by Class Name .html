    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
        head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the
        idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
        and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As
        with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of
        his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography,
        Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a
        great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
        stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding
        in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become
        unsure of whether or not this is true.
